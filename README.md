# The Escape Quiz
The Escape quiz take users through a series of questionst to help determine the best place for their next vacation.

## Purpose
Choosing a vacation spot is tough! This app aids in the decision making process by asking a series of personality questions that determine a recommended trip specifically for you.

## Getting Started
You can view the app on Heroku! If you'd like to dig into the code, download the repository zip file and do an npm install to ensure you have all of the correct dependencies installed and are able to connect to a local host.

## Built With
* [Bootstrap V4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) 
* [jQuery API](http://api.jquery.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)


## Future Ideas
Future enhancements to the site could include:
* Adding additional locations to the array
* Switching up the questions a bit and making multiple choice answers to be even more specific. The logic will ultimately need to change as well as it's based on a numerical difference in user results and location results at the moment.

## Collaboration
Please feel free to collaborate! I hope to pick this back up in the near future to work through the ideas listed out above. If you have any thoughts to share or are interested in collaborating, feel free to reach out.
